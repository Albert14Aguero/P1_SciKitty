## README

### SciKitty Project

This repository contains the code developed by the team consisting of Rony Chinchilla Azofeifa, Andrés León Orozco, and Alberto Agüero Herdocia for the SciKitty project, an academic exercise at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica.

### Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Graphviz and the Graphviz library for Python installed in your Anaconda environment. If not, you can install them by running the following commands:

```bash
conda install python-graphviz
pip install graphviz
```

### Usage

Before running the scripts, make sure to navigate to the 'demos' folder using the following commands:

```bash
cd scikitty
cd demos
```

Once Graphviz and the Graphviz library for Python are installed, you can test the datasets included in this project. Follow these steps:

1. Run the Python file named `fictional_reading_place.py` to work with the first dataset related to fictional reading places.

```bash
python fictional_reading_place.py
```
Now go to the folder inside scikitty named view and open the pdf named `fictional_reading_place.pdf` to see the generated tree.

2. Then, execute the test file `fictional_reading_place_test.py` to verify the functionality of the first dataset.

```bash
python fictional_reading_place_test.py
```
Now go to the folder inside scikitty named view and open the pdf named `fictional_reading_place_tree.pdf` to see the generated tree by the trained model.

3. To test the second dataset related to fictional diseases, run the Python file `fictional_disease.py`.

```bash
python fictional_disease.py
```
Now go to the folder inside scikitty named view and open the pdf named `fictional_disease.pdf` to see the generated tree.


4. Finally, execute the test file `fictional_disease_test.py` to confirm the correct processing of the second dataset.

```bash
python fictional_disease_test.py
```
Now go to the folder inside scikitty named view and open the pdf named `fictional_disease_tree.pdf` to see the generated tree by the trained model.

5. (EXTRA) Execute  the test file `play_tennis.py` to work with the dataset related to if you can play tennis or not.
```bash
python play_tennis.py
```
Now go to the folder inside scikitty named view and open the pdf named `play_tennis.pdf` to see the generated tree.

6. (EXTRA)  execute the test file `play_tennis_test.py` to confirm the correct processing of the second dataset.

```bash
python play_tennis_test.py
```
Now go to the folder inside scikitty named view and open the pdf named `play_tennis_tree.pdf` to see the generated tree by the trained model.
