## README

### SciKitty Project

This repository contains the code developed by the team consisting of Rony Chinchilla Azofeifa, Andrés León Orozco, and Alberto Aguero for the SciKitty project, an academic exercise at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica.

### Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Graphviz and the Graphviz library for Python installed in your Anaconda environment. If not, you can install them by running the following commands:

```bash
conda install python-graphviz
pip install graphviz
```

### Usage

Once Graphviz and the Graphviz library for Python are installed, you can test the datasets included in this project. Follow these steps:

1. Run the Python file named `fictional_reading_place.py` to work with the first dataset related to fictional reading places.

```bash
python fictional_reading_place.py
```

2. Then, execute the test file `fictional_reading_place_test.py` to verify the functionality of the first dataset.

```bash
python fictional_reading_place_test.py
```

3. To test the second dataset related to fictional diseases, run the Python file `fictional_disease.py`.

```bash
python fictional_disease.py
```

4. Finally, execute the test file `fictional_disease_test.py` to confirm the correct processing of the second dataset.

```bash
python fictional_disease_test.py
```
